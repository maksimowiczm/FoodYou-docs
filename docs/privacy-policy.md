*Effective date: 01.01.2026*

This Privacy Policy applies to the Food You app (the "Application") developed by Mateusz
Maksimowicz (the "Service Provider"). The Application is provided on an "AS IS" basis.

## Information Collection and Use

The Application does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or non-personal information. All
data entered or generated within the Application is processed locally on your device and is never
sent to the Service Provider.

## Third-Party Services

The Application may interact with third-party services to provide certain features, such as
retrieving food or nutritional information.

When used for food-related features, the Application retrieves publicly available food data from
third-party services. These requests do not include personal information, and the retrieved data is
stored locally on your device for offline use. The Service Provider does not collect or store this
data on external servers.

The Application does not collect or transmit personal data unless explicitly stated otherwise in
this policy.

The Application may interact with the following third-party services, each governed by their own
privacy policies:

- [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/privacy)
- [USDA FoodData Central (operated by the United States Department of Agriculture)](https://www.usda.gov/privacy-policy)</br>
  *You may optionally provide your own USDA API key, which is stored locally on your device and used
  solely to make requests to this service. The Service Provider does not collect or store this API
  key.*
- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)</br>
  *Used only if you choose to download sponsorship information in the Application.*

## Opt-Out Rights

You can stop all use of the Application at any time by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall
process available on your device or through the application marketplace.

## Children's Privacy

The Application does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of
13\. Since no data is collected at all, no information from children or adults is stored or
processed by the Service Provider.

## Your Consent

By using the Application, you consent to this Privacy Policy.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

The Service Provider may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
