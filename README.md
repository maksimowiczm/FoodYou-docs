## Running the Project Locally

To run the project locally, first install [Zensical](https://zensical.org/docs/get-started/).

For a smoother and more reproducible development experience, [Nix](https://nixos.org/) is
recommended.

After installing the prerequisites, run the following commands to start a local development server:

```sh
nix develop
zensical serve
```

You can then access the website at `http://localhost:8000`.
