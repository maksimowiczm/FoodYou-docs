# Food You

This is source code for the Food You website

## Development

To run the project locally, you must first install
[Zensical](https://zensical.org/docs/get-started/). For a seamless
development experience, it is recommended to use [Nix](https://nixos.org/).
After that, you can run the following commands to start a local development
server:

```sh
nix develop
zensical serve
```

You can then access the website at `http://localhost:8000`.
